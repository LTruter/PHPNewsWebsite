# PHPNewsWebsite
PHP news website project

Create a news website that allows users to register by providing their personal information. Upon successful registration, an email with the user's address and a randomly generated password is sent to the email they provided. The login page will allow users to login using their username and randomly generated password. Once logged in, users can view current Sport, Entertainment and Business news. The user can also change their password, share posts, and log out. Debug and log methods should be implemented, and the MySQLi interface or PHP Data Object may be used to create and include a database with relevant tables.


*Regarding my email code:
Due to changes in Gmail's policies, they no longer allow access to unsafe email setups through their platform. Unfortunately, this affects my project as I was utilizing PHP email functionality, which is now restricted due to these security measures.
Setting up my own email server has proven to be a complex and challenging task, and I will not be able to set one up that can work online without a hosting environment.
Due to this my lecturer has advised me to comment out my code to send an email to the user containing the randomly generated password. I have included steps on how to obtain the randomly generated password from phpMyAdmin on the “How to use the application” page in my documentation file.
