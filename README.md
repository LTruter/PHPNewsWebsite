# PHP news website project

<h2> Description: </h2>

Create a news website that allows users to register by providing their personal information. Upon successful registration, an email with the user's address and a randomly generated password is sent to the email they provided. The login page will allow users to login using their username and randomly generated password. Once logged in, users can view current Sport, Entertainment and Business news. The user can also change their password, share posts, and log out. Debug and log methods should be implemented, and the MySQLi interface or PHP Data Object may be used to create and include a database with relevant tables.

*Please refer to my documentation for more information.
